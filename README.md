# Fibonacci Numbers using Simple Loop

## Definition
In mathematics, the Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Individual numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are known as Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fnâ€Š. The sequence commonly starts from 0 and 1. Starting from 0 and 1, the first few values in the sequence are:[1]

Example of Fibonacci Sequence up to 13:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144.

## The project

The task given was to generate an algorithm in C++ capable to list a Fibonacci Sequence up to a defined sequence number [n] and print it in a terminal on PC or in the LCD of the microcontroller (we used mbed LCP1768 in this case). We have chosen to print the results in the PC.

## Technologies Used

### Microcontroller
* ARM mbed LCP1768 <br />
[mbed](https://os.mbed.com/platforms/mbed-LPC1768/)

### Terminal Emulator 
* Tera Term <br />

### IDE
* Keil Studio <br />

## Troubleshooting

OS mbed version was changed from 6.15.1 to 5.15.2 in order to run Serial USB command to the PC.
